# Musical-Booze


I. Description 

We decided to design this app to help the adult community relax during this quarantine period. Indeed, we all know that every human being has never been called to live alone isolated or even locked in the house. And during this pandemic and social distancing, we had noticed that people find themselves in different moods depending on how they wake up in the morning.
So we decided to create this app called "GOOD SPIRITS".
An app that will help you change or keep your mood or every day. All you have to do is cut your mood and the app will return you a playlist as well as a cocktail to help you improve your mood.
We created this app using all the concepts we learned in school starting with HTML, CSS, the basic concepts of JAVASCRIPT through the manipulation of the DOM and the principles of JQUERY and to conclude we had access to two APIs (Deezer and CocktailDB) to come up with the program.

1. Installation

GOOD SPIRIT is an app that you can easily download with your phone, tablet or computer for free. 
You can only write "GOODSPIRITS" in one word on your Apple store or google Play Store for Androids and you'll have the app on your phone in 30 seconds.

2. Usage

Using "GOOD SPIRITS" is easy and simple. As soon as you open the app, you'll be on the home page where it's written in GOOD SPIRITS Music and booze to improve your mood. 
On the right corner of your screen you will find a button where it says start. 
As soon as you click there, you will be led to a page to confirm that you are over 21 years old given that the law requires us to be 21 years old before consuming an alcoholic beverage.
After confirming this, you will be led to the page that contains the different moods among which could carry your choice (thirst, content, zen, sad, clam, energized).
After choosing your mood you can then choose your kind of music and then you will be offered a playlist combine with a cocktail to allow you to change or keep your mood. Simple.
